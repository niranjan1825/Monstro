# This program opens file1 and file2 concurrently and calculate the repeated no. of words and their duplication count. Another go routine is their for calculating the duplication count and  no. of duplicate words for the combined content of file1 and file2.

# Output currently what it prints.

String Content of File2:: hi hi this is a first trial trial   
File2's Word and repeated times:  trial ----> 2
File2's Word and repeated times:  hi ----> 2
No.of Repeated words in File2 is: 2
Duplication count in File2 is: 4
Combined Content Of File1 and File2: hi hi this is a first trial trial  hey hi hey hi hey hi do yo know what weather is today?. is today's weather  cool??
String Content of File1:: hey hi hey hi hey hi do yo know what weather is today?. is today's weather  cool??
File1's word and repeated times:  hey ----> 3
File1's word and repeated times:  weather ----> 2
File1's word and repeated times:  is ----> 2
File1's word and repeated times:  hi ----> 3
No.of Repeated words in File1 is: 4
Duplication count in File1 is: 10
Combined file's Word and repeated times:  is ----> 3
Combined file's Word and repeated times:  trial ----> 2
Combined file's Word and repeated times:  hey ----> 3
Combined file's Word and repeated times:  weather ----> 2
Combined file's Word and repeated times:  hi ----> 5
